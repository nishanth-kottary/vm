READ	    - read byte from stdin to top of stack
WRT 	    - write byte to stdout from top of 
	      stack
ADD 	    - add top 2 elems of stack and put sum
	      in stack
SUB 	    - subtract topmost element by 2nd 
	      topmost element from stack and put
	      difference in top of stack
MUL 	    - multiply top 2 elems os stack and 
	      put product in top of stack
DIV 	    - Divide topmost elem by 2nd topmost
	      elem and put quotient in top of 
	      stack and remainder below top.
POP 	    - pop topmost elem from stack
EQU 	    - if top 2 elems are equal boolean 
	      flag set to 1 else 0
GRT 	    - is top is greater than second top 
	      boolean flag set to 1 else 0
LST 	    - is top is smaller than second top 
	      boolean flag set to 1 else 0
GOTO 	    - go to instruction number given by 
	      top of stack.
GOIF        - like GOTO but only if boolean flag 
	      set.
GOUN        - like GOTO but only if boolean flag 
	      not set.
END	    - end execution.
LOAD	    - POP from stack and put byte in 
	      general purpose register.
STORE	    - PUSH register byte to stack.
